# remote_launch

Remote roslaunch launching a local PC launch file

## Basic Usage

1. Setup nodes and all roslaunch file config on **PC Foo** (roslaunch files like `include/bringup.launch`)
1. Consider an extra shell script for a centralized and consistent ROS environment sourcing setup 
(e.g. source `include/0rosrc` in *~/.bashrc* and everywhere else)
1. Put the *remote_launch* package on **PC Foo** (catkin workspace, build it, ect. You know the drill) and adjust the `scripts/bringup` to launch your roslaunch file
	- You can also create many more other scripts there ðŸ˜‰
1. Then in the remote roslaunch file on **PC Bar** (e.g. `include/neobotix_bringup_remote.launch`) make sure to use an `env-loader="/home/neobotix/remote_launch.sh"` (this file resides on **PC Foo**), which is setting the respective environment variables on **PC Foo** 
(ROS_IP / ROS_HOSTNAME, especially the correct remote ROS_MASTER_URI of **PC Bar**)
- Optional: Use some auto start fallback logic on **PC Foo** (example `include/ROS_AUTOSTART+remote.sh`)
> You need [rosenv](https://github.com/LJMP/rosenv) to replicate the explained setup or you semi/hardcode all networking/IP settings in your scripts ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜†

ToDo:  
+ [ ] you might need to fix up passwords and usenames in the files
+ [ ] read up on how to setup ssh with keys instead of password strings in plaintext ðŸ˜‹
